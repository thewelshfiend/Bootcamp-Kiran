            <h2>Thought Process</h2>
            <h3>Level 1</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The layout is based on a grid system to organize content effectively across various screen sizes,
                    ensuring responsiveness and usability.</li>
                <li>The use of CSS Grid helps in defining distinct areas for the header, main content, sidebars, and
                    footer, making the webpage flexible and easy to navigate.</li>
                <li>To enhance accessibility, semantic tags like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>,
                    <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> are utilized, improving both user
                    experience and SEO.
                </li>
                <li>For styling, CSS variables are employed to maintain consistent colors and spacing across the
                    webpage, ensuring easier maintenance.</li>
                <li>A theme toggle was implemented to switch between light and dark modes, adding a layer of
                    personalization.</li>
                <li>Lastly, contrast between background and text colors is carefully considered for readability, and
                    hover effects on navigation links enhance interactivity.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Level 2</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The overall layout remains similar, but in this version, additional focus was placed on making the
                    design more flexible and scalable.</li>
                <li>The overflow property has been added to both the body and main content areas to handle excessive
                    content gracefully, ensuring the webpage maintains usability even with more data.</li>
                <li>The grid layout remains consistent, but now there's more emphasis on making the sidebars and main
                    content scroll independently, improving the page's ability to manage content dynamically.</li>
                <li>Another key difference is the use of a slightly darker primary color for the header, providing a
                    stronger visual contrast and making the header more prominent.</li>
                <li>Furthermore, this version continues to prioritize responsiveness with the inclusion of flexible grid
                    columns, but now, with added overflow control, the design adapts even better to different screen
                    sizes or when there's more content to display.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Level 3</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A grid layout is used with specific areas for header, sidebars, main content, and footer.</li>
                <li>Single-column layout for mobile (under 768px) and multi-column for larger screens.</li>
                <li>Responsive design ensures adaptation to different screen sizes.</li>
                <li>Flexbox is used in the 'main' and 'header' sections for better content alignment.</li>
                <li>Dark mode is added, toggling a class on the 'body' for theme switching.</li>
                <li>The layout is modular with sidebars '#sidebar1' and '#sidebar2' beside the main content.</li>
                <li>Structured table design with alternating row colors for readability.</li>
                <li>Fixed footer with contact information for consistent access.</li>
            </ul>
