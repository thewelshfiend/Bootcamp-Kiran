            <h2>Thought Process</h2>
                <h3>Level 1</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>The goal of this webpage is to display a table with items for sale, including their names, prices, and descriptions. I have structured the page to be both functional and visually appealing using CSS for layout and design. Below is the step-by-step approach:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Designing the Layout:</strong> I chose a centered layout for the main content, which includes a table to display the items. The table is styled to be responsive, using CSS to ensure it adapts well to different screen sizes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Styling the Table:</strong> The table is given a simple yet effective design with alternating row colors and hover effects to improve user experience. I utilized CSS variables for easier maintenance and consistent styling across different parts of the page.</li>
                            <li><strong>Table Content:</strong> The table includes 6 items with their respective names, prices, and descriptions. I made sure to keep the descriptions clear and concise.</li>
                            <li><strong>CSS Variables:</strong> The CSS variables were used for colors and styling properties like borders and background colors. This makes the CSS code more modular and easier to adjust later.</li>
                            <li><strong>Accessibility Considerations:</strong> I ensured that the table headers are clearly defined and that the content is readable. The page is designed to be visually appealing yet simple, with a focus on clarity and ease of use.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Overall, the focus was on creating a functional, clean, and responsive layout that displays the information in a user-friendly way.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Level 2</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The webpage layout is designed to display items for sale in a clear and structured table format. The decision to use a table was made because it allows for easy comparison of item names, prices, and descriptions in a grid format. The background colors, borders, and hover effects were chosen to improve readability and user experience.
                        <ul>
                            <li>The items are displayed in rows with alternating background colors to make them visually distinguishable.</li>
                            <li>Price and description details are aligned to the left for clarity.</li>
                            <li>Each item row changes color on hover to give users visual feedback, indicating interactivity.</li>
                        </ul>
                        The decision to import a CSS file (`variables-2.css`) allows for centralized management of styles, particularly for color variables. This ensures consistency across the webpage and makes it easier to update themes in the future.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Level 3</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>The goal of this webpage is to display a table listing items for sale, along with their respective prices and descriptions. Hereâ€™s the thought process followed during the creation:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Choosing the Layout:</strong> The main content is positioned centrally on the page to keep the focus on the items for sale. I used <code>position: absolute</code> along with <code>transform</code> for precise centering.</li>
                            <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> I ensured that the webpage adjusts to different screen sizes by using relative units such as <code>clamp()</code> in width and height properties, ensuring it remains visually balanced across devices.</li>
                            <li><strong>Styling the Table:</strong> The table is styled for clarity and readability. I used custom CSS variables to manage color schemes and table borders, enhancing maintainability. I also included hover effects for better interactivity.</li>
                            <li><strong>CSS Variables:</strong> External CSS variables were used to keep the styles modular. A separate <code>variables-3.css</code> file holds color and design values like background colors and borders, which are imported into the main stylesheet.</li>
                            <li><strong>Table Design:</strong> The table headers have a distinct background color for emphasis. I made sure alternating rows have a slightly different background color for better readability.</li>
                            <li><strong>Text and Paragraphs:</strong> The paragraph under the table provides additional context, styled for clarity with a comfortable font size.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul>
